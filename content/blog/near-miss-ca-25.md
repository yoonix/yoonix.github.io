Just a quick post to share a dashcam video from a few months ago.  My mother
and I were driving down CA-25 (also known as Airline Highway).  It runs from
Hollister down by the eastern entrance to Pinnacles National Park.  

This video was at (least) highway speeds.  This would've been a 110+ MPH
head-on collision.

The audio has been stripped since it's mostly swearing.
