Wow.  It’s hard for me to believe it has been almost 30 years since I began my career (and life) online.

I began my life online in the mid 90s, immediately after high school graduation.  I wish I had began earlier but I didn’t have a computer that I was allowed to really do much with until then.  If I couldn’t be a professional baseball player or an astronaut, I knew I wanted to work with computers since 1983.  The year WarGames was released.

Within a year and a half of getting that computer for graduation, I was on my second ‘tech’ job.  Building a dial-up ISP from scratch with just one other guy.  I handled most of the technical side of things and he handled virtually all of the business.

I actively participated in many of the popular technical mailing lists and news groups (USENET) of the time, primarily related to FreeBSD and BSD/OS (a former commercial BSD-based offering).  I even had a small amount of C code (I’m not a programmer!) committed to the FreeBSD code base to add a trivial feature.

I was heavily involved in the Quake / QuakeWorld CTF (Capture the Flag) communities when that game was the hottest thing around.  I was an active member in a fairly well-known Quake Clan that released a professional-quality map pack to the community free of charge.  I was the ‘sysadmin’ for the Clan, hosting our community-focused strategy and training website until that site became the part of a much larger commercial endeavor.

A decade later I was dragged kicking and screaming to play the MMO World of Warcraft and ended up falling in love just as I did with ThreeWave CTF.  I ran the forum for our guild.  I created videos to share with our server when we had major accomplishments.  I helped run a fairly complex site to help track points to ensure fair loot distribution amongst our members.

Professionally, I spent a lot of time on ServerFault over the years.  I love the concept of the site; a ‘StackOverflow Style’ site (run by the same company) that was focused to the technical professional.  The site attracts far too many ‘free-loaders’, people that are looking for quick answers to complicated engineering problems they aren’t (necessarily) qualified to answer themselves.  In my opinion, of course.  I eventually stopped participating and deleted my account (to prevent the temptation).  Maybe that last part was dumb because…

I’ve actively spent over 25 years of my life online and I’m a ghost!  Doing web searches for my name, the handles I’ve used over the years, even my own email address lead to almost nothing related to me.  It’s as if I was never here.

Well, I hope to change that.
